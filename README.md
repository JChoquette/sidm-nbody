Monte Carlo N-body Simulation for Self-Interacting Dark Matter


## About this code

Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) is a hypothetical model for cold
dark matter in the Universe. A strong interaction between dark
matter particles introduce a different physics inside dark-matter
haloes, making the density profile cored, reduce the number of subhaloes,
and trigger gravothermal collapse.

This is an N-body simulation code with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
scattering for self interaction, and some codes to analyse
gravothermal collapse of isolated haloes (see Koda & Shapiro 2011
[[1]]). The N-body simulation is based on GADGET 1.1 [[2]].

## Current status

This repository is now working in progress. More instructions on how
to run is coming...
